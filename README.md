# Robotics-Vision
Computer vision model trained for object detection on an autonomous robot using Tensorflow Object detection API

## Getting Started

Run the following command:
```
python video_inference.py video_path False
```
The second argument is used to save the annotated video or not.
This reads a video and performs inference using the trained model. The output video should look like the following:

Alternatively, you can also run the associated object_detection_tutorial.ipynb Jupyter notebook.
